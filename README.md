# twidit-app
This is a app like twitter(mostly) and reddit (twidit).
This is a bare minimum copy of twitter.
It has features like follow, comment, like, and search (but there are no users lol).
This is made of firebase, next-auth, nextjs, react-bootstrap.
This app is not responsive (cz i didnt use bootstrap ) so dont play with it, it will look like dogshit if you minimise size of page.
This app is mostly client side.
